# Magic Feather (minecraft mod)

This mod adds a Magic Feather that gives its bearer creative flight within the range of a vanilla beacon.

## Why ?

I like the Angel Ring from Extra Utilities but find it removes the fun out of travelling 
in minecraft. It renders horses, minecarts, boats, and the elytra completely useless.

It also makes certain challenges too easy (twilight forest, ender dragon, ...).

This system lets you have creative flight in and around your base without removing the fun flying around in an elytra. It also promotes building vanilla beacons which are underused.
